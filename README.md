Our project is a **blockchain-based charity donation platform** designed to ensure **transparent**, **secure**, and **efficient** donations using Ethereum smart contracts. The platform allows donors to connect their **MetaMask wallets**, donate **Ether (ETH)**, and view real-time donation history and total contributions. All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing **trust** and **accountability** without the need for intermediaries.

## Features

- **Blockchain Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: View real-time donation history and the total contributions made to the platform.
- **No Intermediaries**: The platform eliminates intermediaries, ensuring direct donations from donors to charities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is simple, intuitive, and built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **Web3.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
